      <h2>What do we do?</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of health professionals, experts in stress of the nervous
        system. Through chiropractic adjustments we are able to release the
        “bad” stress which causes dis-ease, back problems and health problems in
        general and bring you back to balance and homeostasis.

      <h2>What is Chiropractic?</h2>
      <p>
        As a profession, chiropractic has been in existence since 1898.
        According to the Rubicon group, Chiropractic is a health-care profession
        based on a neo-vitalistic philosophy due to its natural focus on health
        and wellness, exluding drugs and surgery.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a Chiropractic Subluxation?</h2>
      <p>The term subluxation is currently defined as:</p>
        <q style="font-style: italic;">…a self-perpetuating,
        central segmental motor control problem that involves a joint, such as a
        vertebral motion segment, that is not moving appropriately, resulting in
        ongoing maladaptive neural plastic changes that interfere with the
        central nervous system's ability to self-regulate, self-organize, adapt,
        repair and heal</q>

      <h1>Before adjusting</h1>
        <p>
        Chiropractors don't just adjust anywhere in the spine. Before adjusting
        you, the Chiroractor will have carried out a thorough exploration, which
        includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            Health questionnaire, including previous health history of the patient
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluation of movement/biomechanics of the spine and other joints;
            <li>Orthopaedic testing</li>
          </li>
          <li>Chiropractic testing (postural tests, kinesiology tests)</li>
          <li>
            Superficial electromyology testing (Myovision SEMG), which measures
            electrical activity in the spinal muscles, and thereby evaluates
            dysfunctional patterns;
          </li>
          <li>
            Thermography tests (Nervoscope), measuring temperature (inflammation)
            on both sides of the spine to discover discrepancies
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes you may be asked for x-rays, MRI's or other imaging, blood
            tests, to be able to have a more complete medical history.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When a spinal segment doesn't move correctly, ie., a vertebral
          subluxation, this can really influence the way the brain perceives and
          responds to all the sensorial information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subluxations can have different types of components: biomechanical,
          neurological, trophic and psicosocial. Our habits and lifestyle are
          usually the origin of subluxations. Physical stress: bad postures,
          repeated strain, falls or accidents; chemical factors: hormonal
          inbalance, alcohol, tabacco, refined food or prepared food; and
          emotional factors: stress, arguments with your spouse/boss, loss of a
          loved one, etc; all of these things can affect our balance and wellness,
          giving rise to subluxations.
        </p>
      <h2>Chiropractic Care</h2>
        <p>
          Chiropractic care consists mainly of specific chiropractic adjustments.
          The science shows that three months of chiropractic care improves the
          physical aspect of health, which is related to quality of life. 12 weeks
          of chiropractic care will improve sensorimotor function and will help
          you feel better and enjoy a better quality of life physically and
          emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various studies have shown that chiropractic care changes the way in
          which your brain sends messages to your muscles. This indicates that
          chiropractic care improves the communication between the brain and the
          body, helping the brain to become more conscious of what is happening in
          the body, so that the brain can better control the body.
        </p>
