          What do we do?
          We are a team of health professionals, experts in stress of the nervous system. Through chiropractic adjustments we are able to release the “bad” stress which causes dis-ease, back problems and health problems in general and bring you back to balance and homeostasis.
          
          What is Chiropractic?
          As a profession, chiropractic has been in existence since 1898.
          According to the Rubicon group, Chiropractic is a health-care profession based on a neo-vitalistic philosophy due to its natural focus on health and wellness, exluding drugs and surgery.
          
          There are approximately 100.000 chiropractors worldwide, educated in over 40 universities, where students graduate after a minimum of 5 years of studies.
          
          What is a Chiropractic Subluxation?
          The term subluxation is currently defined as “…a self-perpetuating, central segmental motor control problem that involves a joint, such as a vertebral motion segment, that is not moving appropriately, resulting in ongoing maladaptive neural plastic changes that interfere with the central nervous system’s ability to self-regulate, self-organize, adapt, repair and heal” (The Rubicon Group, May 2017). Reference to original article: https://www.therubicongroup.org/policies/
          
          Chiropractors don’t just adjust anywhere in the spine. Before adjusting you, the Chiroractor will have carried out a thorough exploration, which includes:
          – Health questionnaire, including previous health history of the patient;
          – Evaluation of movement / biomechanics of the spine and other joints;
          Orthopaedic testing;
          – Chiropractic testing (postural tests, kinesiology tests);
          – Superficial electromyology testing (Myovision SEMG), which measures electrical activity in the spinal muscles, and thereby evaluates dysfunctional patterns;
          – Thermography tests (Nervoscope), measuring temperature (inflammation) on both sides of the spine to discover discrepancies;
          – Sometimes you may be asked for x-rays, MRI’s or other imaging, blood tests, to be able to have a more complete medical history.
          
          When a spinal segment doesn’t move correctly, ie., a vertebral subluxation, this can really influence the way the brain perceives and responds to all the sensorial information.
          
          Subluxations can have different types of components: biomechanical, neurological, trophic and psicosocial. Our habits and lifestyle are usually the origin of subluxations. Physical stress: bad postures, repeated strain, falls or accidents; chemical factors: hormonal inbalance, alcohol, tabacco, refined food or prepared food; and emotional factors: stress, arguments with your spouse/boss, loss of a loved one, etc; all of these things can affect our balance and wellness, giving rise to subluxations.
          
          Chiropractic Care
          Chiropractic care consists mainly of specific chiropractic adjustments. The science shows that three months of chiropractic care improves the physical aspect of health, which is related to quality of life. 12 weeks of chiropractic care will improve sensorimotor function and will help you feel better and enjoy a better quality of life physically and emotionally.
          
          Various studies have shown that chiropractic care changes the way in which your brain sends messages to your muscles.
          This indicates that chiropractic care improves the communication between the brain and the body, helping the brain to become more conscious of what is happening in the body, so that the brain can better control the body.
