          Sciatic pain can be debilitating, but there is hope with Chiropractic
        </h1>
        <p>
          I first found out about Nilsson Chiropractic Centre through a friend
          of mine whose husband had been attending the Centre with great
          results. The initial reason for my visit was a trapped sciatic nerve,
          which I had had for many years. I had a total recovery and am no
          longer in extreme pain. I followed the schedule of appointments that
          the Chiropractors recommended to me and followed their advice on
          exercise and posture. As well as help with the sciatica, I had
          improved mobility, more flexibility, I was able to sleep better, my
          breathing improved, my mood improved and was able to deal better with
          stress and a general improvement in my well-being. I would recommend
          Chiropractic to my friends and family. In my experience chiropractic
          is to make oneÂ´s life as free from anxiety and pain as possible.

        <p>
          I first met Nilsson Chiropractic Centre at a local trade fair and
          decided to have a check-up as I had had backache for a number of years
          with various degrees of discomfort. My back problems are almost
          non-existent, and my general posture has improved. I sleep better,
          have better flexibility and strength, which are all bonuses.
