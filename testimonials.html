            Sciatic pain can be debilitating, but there is hope with
            Chiropractic
          </h1>
          <p>
            I first found out about Nilsson Chiropractic Centre through a friend
            of mine whose husband had been attending the Centre with great
            results. The initial reason for my visit was a trapped sciatic
            nerve, which I had had for many years. I had a total recovery and am
            no longer in extreme pain. I followed the schedule of appointments
            that the Chiropractors recommended to me and followed their advice
            on exercise and posture.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as help with the sciatica, I had improved mobility, more
            flexibility, I was able to sleep better, my breathing improved, my
            mood improved and was able to deal better with stress and a general
            improvement in my well-being. I would recommend Chiropractic to my
            friends and family. In my experience chiropractic is to make one's
            life as free from anxiety and pain as possible.

          <p>
            I first met Nilsson Chiropractic Centre at a local trade fair and
            decided to have a check-up as I had had backache for a number of
            years with various degrees of discomfort. My back problems are
            almost non-existent, and my general posture has improved. I sleep
            better, have better flexibility and strength, which are all bonuses.

          <h1>I couldn't move without help from my husband</h1>
          <p>
            I have in in a very bad condition with my body for the last year. I
            couldn't move without help from my husband. I would like in bed in
            pain, I couldn't do anything without having pain all over my body. I
            was lucky and found Nilsson Chiropractic Centre through an advert in
            the newspaper and made an appointment. I received chiropractic care
            and finally I recovered to a stable condition in a really short
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My thanks go to Nilsson Chiropractic Centre for their professional
            competence. Johan's ability to listen made me feel safe as a patient
            right from the beginning and I like the way he explained the
            procedures applied. This established a great relationship which is
            the basic for a successful outcome.

            A fractured skull led to losing my sense of smell and taste, as well
            as losing my hearing.
          </h1>
          <p>
            I had fractured my skull in June 2004 which had caused me to lose
            the senses of smell and taste, accompanied by a loss of hearing in
            my right ear and terrible pain. I had problems with neck pain and
            shoulder for at least 30 years. After chiropractic care from Johan
            my senses of smell and taste returned! Also, having had a total loss
            of hearing I have recuperated some hearing an feel it will continue
            to improve as long as I keep up with the fantastic level of
            chiropractic care I have received.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be free of pain and the general sense of wellbeing has enhanced
            my life tremendously! If I keep up with chiropractic care, my
            hearing will improve which will prevent surgery! I have also noticed
            better back posture, I breathe better and have more flexibility. I
            sleep better, less mood swings, less stress and better sense of
            wellbeing. I really do feel everyone would benefit from chiropractic
            care as I feel a lot of general complaints stem from mis-alignment
            of the spine. Aches and pains or illness that people may have had
            for years improve or disappear completely once you start to receive
            chiropractic care.
